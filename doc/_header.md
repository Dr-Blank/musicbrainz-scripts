**[Bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) and other JavaScript snippets for MusicBrainz.org**

In order to use one of the bookmarklets you have to save the compressed code snippet from the respective section below as a bookmark. Make sure to add the bookmark to a toolbar of your browser which you can easily access while you are editing.

Running `node run build` compiles [all bookmarklets](src/bookmarklets/) and generates an updated version of `README.md` which is based on the most recent version of the code. Before you can run this command you have to ensure that you have setup *Node.js* and have installed the dependencies of the build script via `npm install`.
